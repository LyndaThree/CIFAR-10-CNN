# CIFAR-10-CNN
Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

Uses Keras' Deep Learning library to build the CNN, and Keras' tuner library to find
the optional hyperparameters. See writeup for detailed information on data cleaning, 
model training, hyperparameter descriptions/values, and final model used.
